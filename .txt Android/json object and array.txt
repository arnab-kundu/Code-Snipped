json object

A JSON object contains key/value pairs like map. The keys are strings and the values are the JSON types. Keys and values are separated by comma. The { (curly brace) represents the json object.

{  
    "employee": {  
        "name":       "sachin",   
        "salary":      56000,   
        "married":    true  
    }  
}  
json array

The [ (square bracket) represents the json array.

["Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"]  
Let's take another example of json array.

{ "Employee" :  
    [  
     {"id":"101","name":"Sonoo Jaiswal","salary":"50000"},  
     {"id":"102","name":"Vimal Jaiswal","salary":"60000"}  
    ]   
}
